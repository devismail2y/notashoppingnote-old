# Wireless Sensor Network

## Application
Facility management: intrusion detection into industrial sites, control of leakages in chemical plants.

Machine surveillance and preventive maintenance: embed sensing/control function into places no cable has gone before. I.e. tire pressure monitoring.

Precision agriculture: bring out fertilizer/pesticides/irrigation only where needed.

Medicine and healthcare: post-operative or intensive care, long-term surveillance of chronically ill patients or the elderly.

Logistics: equip goods with a sensor node//

## Roles of Participants in WSN
**Sources of data**: measure data, report them "somewhere", typically equip with different kinds of actual sensors.

**Sinks of data**: interested in receiving data from WSN, may be part of the WSN or external entity, PDA, gateway, etc.

**Actuators**: control some device based on data, usually also a sink
