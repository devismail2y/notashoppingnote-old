# Infrastructure-Based Wireless Network
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020211213104236.png)

* Base stations connected to a wired backbone network.
* Mobile entities communicate wirelessly to these base stations
* Traffic between different mobile entities is relayed by base stations and wired backbone
* Mobility is supported by switching from one base station to another
* Backbone infrastructure is required for administrative tasks, i.e. pulsa.

**Infrastructure free network**

- Military networking
- Finding out empty parking lots without asking server
- Personal area networking (watch, glasses, PDA, medical appliance)

## Application
Facility management: intrusion detection into industrial sites, control of leakages in chemical plants.

Machine surveillance and preventive maintenance: embed sensing/control function into places no cable has gone before. I.e. tire pressure monitoring.

Precision agriculture: bring out fertilizer/pesticides/irrigation only where needed.

Medicine and healthcare: post-operative or intensive care, long-term surveillance of chronically ill patients or the elderly.

Logistics: equip goods with a sensor node//

## Roles of Participants in WSN
**Sources of data**: measure data, report them "somewhere", typically equip with different kinds of actual sensors.

**Sinks of data**: interested in receiving data from WSN, may be part of the WSN or external entity, PDA, gateway, etc.

**Actuators**: control some device based on data, usually also a sink
