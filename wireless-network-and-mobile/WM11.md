# Infrastructure-Based & Infrastructure-Less Wireless Network
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020211213104236.png)

* Base stations connected to a wired backbone network.
* Mobile entities communicate wirelessly to these base stations
* Traffic between different mobile entities is relayed by base stations and wired backbone
* Mobility is supported by switching from one base station to another
* Backbone infrastructure is required for administrative tasks, i.e. pulsa.

**Infrastructure free network** = ad hoc networks

- Military networking
- Finding out empty parking lots without asking server
- Personal area networking (watch, glasses, PDA, medical appliance)

But...
- without central infrastructure, it is pretty much complicated
	- lack of central entity for administration
	- limited range of wireless communication
	- mobility of participants
	- battery-operated entities. 
	- mobility

Mobile ad hoc networks (MANET)

- mobility changes neighborhood relationship
- complicated by scale

They have to organize themselves
- medium access control - access sharing
- finding network route

**Multi-hopping** - being in the middle of infrastructure and infrastructure free

The phone helping others that doesn't catch the route to infrastructure network.

## Battery Operated Devices
- Often is the participants in an ad hoc network or mobile devices.
- Desired to have enough network connectivity and long battery life
- Application: using multi-hop routes with low energy consumption

 ## Wireless Sensor Networks / Wireless Sensor & Actuation
 Instead interaction on humans like most other devices, WSN focus on interacting with the environment.
 - the network is embedded in the environment
 - nodes can be equipped with sensor and actuation
 - nodes process information and communicate it using wireless communication
 
### Application
- Disaster relief operation.
- Biodiversity mapping
- Intelligent building
- Facility management: intrusion detection into industrial sites, control of leakages in chemical plants.
- Machine surveillance and preventive maintenance: embed sensing/control function into places no cable has gone before. I.e. tire pressure monitoring.
- Precision agriculture: bring out fertilizer/pesticides/irrigation only where needed.
 - Medicine and healthcare: post-operative or intensive care, long-term surveillance of chronically ill patients or the elderly.
- Logistics: equip goods with a sensor node
- Telematics: city traffic control, intelligent roadside

### Roles of Participants in WSN
**Sources of data**: measure data, report them "somewhere", typically equip with different kinds of actual sensors.

**Sinks of data**: interested in receiving data from WSN, may be part of the WSN or external entity, PDA, gateway, etc.

**Actuators**: control some device based on data, usually also a sink

**The interaction**
- Event detection: nodes detect events -> report these events to certain sinks
- Periodic measurement
- Functional approximation -> use sensor to approximate a function of space or time (i.e. temperature map)
- Edge detection (abnormality detection): find edges in such a function (i.e. where is the zero degree border line)
- Tracking: report position of an observed intruder.

**Sensor nodes deployment**
- Random deployment - i.e. dropped from aircraft
- Regular deployment - fixed location
- Mobile sensor nodes 
	- can move to compensate for deployment shortcoming
	- can passively move around by external force
	- or actively seek out interesting areas

**Maintenance**
- Feasible to maintain or not? -> i.e. when changing battery
- Maybe other source of energy supply -> i.e. solar cells

**Characteristic requirements**
Type of service of WSN
- not simply moving bits like another networks
- issues: geographic scoping, etc

Quality of Service
- doesn't apply traditional QoS metrics
- right answer at the right time

Fault tolerance
- robust against node failure (running out of energy, physical impact)

Lifetime
- as long as possible
- lifetime of individual nodes relatively unimportant

Scalability

Wide range of densities

Programmability
- can be reprogram if necessary

Maintanability
- adapt to changes, self-monitoring
- incorporate additional resources i.e. newly deployed nodes

**Manet vs WSN**
