Widely used in wireless sensor network, IEEE 802.15.4-2006
- ultra-low power
- low-data rate
- industrial monitoring
- control applications requiring small amounts of data
- turned off most off the time (<1% duty cycle)

i.e. wireless light switches, meter reading, patient monitoring

Less complex 32 kB protocol stack vs 250kB Bluetooth

range 1 to 100 m, up to 65000 nodes

Tri band:
- 16 channels at 250 kbps in 2.4GHz ISM (Industrual Scientific and Medical) band (only available this band in Indonesia)
- 10 Channels at 40kbps in 915 MHz ISM band
- 1 channel at 20 kbps in European 868 MHz band

It works on months or even years in one fully charge of battery

### Network Topology

Two types of devices 
- Full Function Devices (FFD) for network routing and link coordination
- Reduced Function Devices (RFD): simple send/receive devices. i.e. sensor -> it can sends the data to FFD that has routing capability.

## Body Area Network

 Patented by Microsoft: Method and apparatus for transmitting power and data using the human body.
 
 In conjunction with wearable computing.
 i.e. clothes, shoes, glasses, watch.
 
 ## IEEE Activities in WPAN
 Some of it is not active anymore

 ## Assignment
First:
- Read a standard in WPAN (Zigbee, Bluetooth, Visible Light Communication, etc).
 - Make a short essay (2-3 pages) about WPAN standard and its potential application. (opinion and subjective view)

Second:
Install OMNet++
