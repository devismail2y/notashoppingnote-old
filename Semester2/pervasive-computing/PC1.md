## Computing Eras
- Mainframe
	- Many people, one computer
	- Fixed, central location
- PC
	- One person, one computer
	- Fixed location, decentralized
- Pervasive (Ubiquitous)
	- One person, many computers
	- Maybe a smart devices or mobile
	- Sometimes invisible directly to the users

## Pervasive Computing
An environment which people interact with embedded (and mostly invisible) computers and in which networked devices are aware of their surroundings and peers and are able to provide services or use services from peers effectively.


Characteristics
1. Physical integration: integration between computing nodes and the physical worlds, e.g. white board that records what's on.
2. Instantaneous interoperation (interoperate in changing environments)

Non-Examples of Pervasive Applications
1. Accessing email over a phone line from a laptop
