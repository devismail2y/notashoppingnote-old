# Models for Service and Resource Discovery in Pervasive Computing

## Service Oriented Architecture
- Way to make software components reusable and interoperable via service interfaces. 
- Loosely-coupled services and have evocable interfaces to be called upon to create a process.

### SOA Concept

- Service provider: defines the service description and publishes it to the service registry.
- Service requester: the one who
- Service registry

//

## Service Discovery
### JINI
- service oriented framework for constructing distributed system.
- enable users to share services and resources over network.

### Service Location Protocol (SLP)
- By IETF (The Internet Engineering Task Force)
- Scalable framework for the discovery and selection //
- The components //
	- User Agent
	- Service Agent
	- Directory Agent

### Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)
- //
- Offer seamless connectivity to devices within a network
- The components
	- Devices
	- Control point

### Bluetooth SDP
- Used by Bluetooth client application in order to discover the available service in Bluetooth services.
- Establish the searching mechanism for services.

### Comparison

Suitability of Existing Models for Pervasive System
- Pervasive systems are heterogeneous and dynamic networks with limited devices.
- Bluetooth has a peer-to-peer approach
- Jini and SLP relies on a central registry

## Conclusion
- Pervasive systems do not only represent a set of mobile devices but also an environment that offers services to the users.
