# Interoperability

## Definition
Ability to cooperate within the system component in order to achieve the goal. The component can be in different abstraction. The need of interoperability is  in every level of organization.

The level of interoperability
1. Organizational interoperability: business process integration beyond the boundaries of a single organization.
2. Semantic interoperability:  ensuring the same meaning of exchanged data through predefined and shared meaning of terms and expression.
3. Syntatic interoperability: exchange of information through predefined data format and structure.
4. Technical interoperability: technical end-to-end exchange of data among systems.


## Example Interoperability Within the Computer
Challenge: the need of peripheral becoming more and more. Computer's architecture relatively static when the peripheral is more varied.  

Strategy: 
- Using base architecture
- Using interface standard (IEEE 1394-firewire, or USB)
