# Interface

interface -> public area , create independency between client and server.

Public area: where is the request and reply meet.
Private area: implementation of the request.

Object Oriented says everything is object and the interaction between objects.

## CORBA
Corba not an application but a specification for interoperability. Communcate using Internet Interoperability Protocol (IIOP). CORBA not uaing traditional client server definition but communication between objects. 

OMA architecture:

Vertical Corba facilities: domain specific objects that provide common service in specific application areas.
Health -> the object: medical record
education -> the object: transcript

Horizontal CORBA facilities: objects that provide common services for end-user applications, such as: authentication, file manager, document manipulation.

Communications are handled by ORB(Object Request Broker)

## Weakness of CORBA
Biggest drawback of CORBA is that the architecture is too complex compared with normal client-server interface model. The code itself is complex.


The deployment itself is unrealistic, because the compiler IDL must compile at the same time to be interoperable within each other.

Constrained with one single programming language. Because application development tools:
- MICO -> can handle C++
- JacORB -> can handle Java
