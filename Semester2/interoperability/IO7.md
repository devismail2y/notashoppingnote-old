# Interoperability Framework

## Interoperability Framework
The framework is domain oriented  
  
Framework per domain, why no unified framework for interoperability?
Because they have different business process, such as military and healthcare system have different business process, so they also have different framework.  
  
example:
- e-GIF(e-government interoperability)
	- define common element set, i.e. vocabulary, concept, principles, regulatory, recommendation, standard, and cooperation practice.
	- enables seamless flow of information across government / public service organization.
	- set of practical standard using stable well supported products.
	- provide support, guidance and toolkits to enable the standards to be met.
	- provide a long-term strategy, able to accommodate and adapt.
