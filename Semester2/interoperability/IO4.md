# Object Oriented Concept

## Definition
Object is a representation of an entity that has a certain mean. The object has an abstraction. Example: On the academic system of a campus, the objects are students, lecturer, class, subjects, curriculum, lab, etc.   

Objects are independent: every object is a self entity with certain role and responsibility.
