# Data Mining

## Information
Data > Information > Knowledge > Wisdom

Information is data in graph.
Knowledge used by engineers. To predict something in the future.
Wisdom impacts so many people usually from the leaders, policy (so many decisions to be considered).

Machine as decision support.
The one makes decision is human, computer can only suggest. The one is responsibile is human. So becareful when you are using machine learning to support decision.

Now sensors are cheap, we can spread the sensors everywhere.

Evidence-based medicine is now the standard (this one is expensive), this evidence-based can now support expertise based decision making that only dependable soultion before.

The company that utilizing data is now the leader.

From data to knowledge: Patterns, you have to extract the knowledge from the data to create the advantage from it.  

Blackbox models vs transparent models?

## Data Science
Data mining is how to extract data to find knowledge. More practical.

Machine learning is how you use the extracted knowledge. More theoritical.

Problem in data mining
- Most patterns are not interesting
- Patterns may be inexact (spurious)
- Data may be garbled or missing

Still in Machine Learning and human expertise right now there is big gap. Machine Learning based on heuristic knowledge, but this is called shallow knowledge. And the human's expertise is called deep knowledge. So there is long way to machine to replace human's knowledge and decision making.

## Rule Set
Rule set can not be thousands rules, because it is called blackbox. It should be 30 rules or 200 ruies are still ok.

Classification is decision based on condition, i.e Yes, No, High, Medium, Low, etc.
Regression is decision in numeric value, i.e. GPU performance. You can not use linear regression for data that is not linear.


## Overfit
If you have too many variants, there will be bias of your data. So you need to reduce the varient.

Look for the consistent data first, and then you can try for perfect the result.

## Ethics
- Remove ID that indicates the patients (on medical)
- Racial issue, because it is computer result! Becareful what you input on the machine.
- We can not trust 100% on the data.
