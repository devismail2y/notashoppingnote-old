# The Hopfield Network

Different form of neural network, it uses brain memory by association. To emulate the characteristics, it needs different type of network : **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**

RNN has feedback loops from its output to its inputs, the presence of the loops create advantage on the learning capability.

On previous RNN, it has stability issues. However, Hopfield network, can dynamically stores information in dynamic stable network.

Diagram of Hopfield network, the output is fed into other inputs.

The Hopfield network uses McCulloch and Pitts neurons with the sign activation function.

Because the Hopfield network is determined by the current outputs of all neuron, it can be defined by the state vector as:

Synaptic weights between neurons is represented in matrix form:
