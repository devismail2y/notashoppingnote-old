Data rate comparison depending on mobility
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020211213093941.png)

Stationary = steady location
Nomadic = low-speed mobility
vehicular = high speed mobility

## Bluetooth
1-10 m communications
Medium rate - 720 kbps, use frequency hopping, has application specific profiles

## UWB (Ultra Wide Band)
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020211213094710.png)

UWB usually represented in time domain, not frequency domain. Because it looks like a white noise(background noise) to other devices.

Limited signal, using only one frequency, using repeating signal.


FCC rules restrict the maximun noise generated by wireless equipment 0dbm = 1mW to -40dBm = 0.1 $\mu$ watt

Very short signal pulses (sub-nano second)

UWB is used for high-speed over short distances i.e. wireless USB

UWB can be used for position tracking (centimeter accuracy) or used for underground radar. It is being used to track worker inside a warehouse.

Advantage of UWB:
- very low energy consumption
- passes through walls
- precise motion detection (5-30 cm error margin)
- can use multipath to advantage
- difficult to intercept
- low cost
- small size


## Zigbee
https://www.zigbee.org
https://csa-iot.org
https://zigbeealliance.org

Widely used in wireless sensor network, IEEE 802.15.4-2006
- ultra-low power
- low-data rate
- industrial monitoring
- control applications requiring small amounts of data
- turned off most off the time (<1% duty cycle)

i.e. wireless light switches, meter reading, patient monitoring

Less complex 32 kB protocol stack vs 250kB Bluetooth

range 1 to 100 m, up to 65000 nodes

Tri band:
- 16 channels at 250 kbps in 2.4GHz ISM (Industrual Scientific and Medical) band (only available this band in Indonesia)
- 10 Channels at 40kbps in 915 MHz ISM band
- 1 channel at 20 kbps in European 868 MHz band

It works on months or even years in one fully charge of battery

### Network Topology
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020211124125101.png)

Two types of devices 
- Full Function Devices (FFD) for network routing and link coordination
- Reduced Function Devices (RFD): simple send/receive devices. i.e. sensor -> it can sends the data to FFD that has routing capability.

## Body Area Network
 ![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020211124125412.png)
 
 Patented by Microsoft: Method and apparatus for transmitting power and data using the human body.
 
 In conjunction with wearable computing.
 i.e. clothes, shoes, glasses, watch.
 
 ## IEEE Activities in WPAN
 Some of it is not active anymore
 ![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020211124125837.png)
 
 ## Assignment
First:
- Read a standard in WPAN (Zigbee, Bluetooth, Visible Light Communication, etc).
 - Make a short essay (2-3 pages) about WPAN standard and its potential application. (opinion and subjective view)

Second:
Install OMNet++, read the installation guides

### Omnet Installation on Ubuntu 20.04
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBRrhuaMxGk

Preparation on dependancies
```bash
sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list
# add entry at the last line "deb http://cz.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic main universe"

sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc g++ bison flex perl \
python python3 qt5-default libqt5opengl5-dev tcl-dev tk-dev \
libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev default-jre doxygen graphviz libwebkitgtk-3.0-0 \

openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev libpcap-dev \
```
 
 Download : https://omnetpp.org/download/
```bash
mkdir app && tar xzfv {FILENAME} ~/app
vim .bashrc
# add entry at the last line "export PATH=$HOME/app/omnetpp-5.7/bin:$PATH"
cd app/omnetpp-5.7
. setenv
make
```

Test the environment
```bash
cd samples/dyna
./dyna
# set to 8 computer
# run (make sure its running)
# stop
```

Run Omnetpp IDE
```bash
omnetpp
```
