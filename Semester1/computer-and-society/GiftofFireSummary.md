# GIft of Fire - Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing Technology(2012)

This is a summary
## Chapter 2: Privacy (until 2.3)
> It is clear that we cannot expect complete privacy.

Three aspects of privacy:
1. Freedom from intrusion - being left alone.
2. Control of information about oneself.
3. Freedom from surveillance(from being followed, tracked, watched, and eavesdropped upon)

However concern for privacy may be regarded with a suspicious question: "What do you have to hide?" The desire to keep things private does not mean we are doing anything wrong.

Privacy threats categories:
1. Intentional, institutional use of personal information. In government: law enforcement and tax collection. In private sector: marketing and decision making.
2. Unauthorized use or release by "insiders" the people who maintain the information.
3. Theft of information.
4. Inadvertent leakage of information through negligence or carelessness.
5. Our own actions.

> If you live in a small town, you have little privacy, everyone knows everything about you. If you live in big city, you are more nearly anonymous. But if people knows nothing about you, they might be taking a big risk if they rent you a place, accept your credit card, lend you money, etc.

Today there are thousands or millions of database containing personal information about us.

### Example
**Smartphone**
Some Android or iPhones send location data essentially the location of nearby cell towers to Google and Apple. The location data is supposed to be anonymous, but researchers found in some cases, that it included the phone ID.

A major bank announced that its free mobile banking app inadvertently stored account numbers and security access codes in a hidden file on the user's phone. If someone found the flaw, he can access that hidden file.

### Risks
1. Anything we do in cyberspace is recorded, at least briefly and linked to our computer or phone, and possibly our name.
2. With huge amount of storage space available, companies, organizations, and governments save huge amounts of data that no one would have imagined.
3. People often  are not aware of the collection of the information.
4. Software is extremely complex, sometimes web managers do not even know what the software they use collects and stores.
5. Leaks happen.
6. A collection of many small items of information can give a fairly detailed picture of a person's life.
7. Direct association with person's name is not essential for compromising privacy. Re-identification has become much easier due to the quantity of personal information stored and the power of data search and analysis tools.
8. If information is on a public website, people other than those for whom it was intended will find it. It is available to everyone.
9. Once information goes on the internet or into a database, it seems to last forever. People can make and distribute copies. It is almost impossible to remove released information from circulation.
10. It is extremely likely that data collected for one purpose (i.e. making a phone call or responding to a search query) will find other uses (i.e. business planning, tracking, marketing, or criminal investigation).
11. The government sometimes requests or demands sensitive personal data held by businesses and organizations.
12. We often cannot directly protect information about ourselves. We depend on the business and organizations that manage it to protect from thieves, accidental collection, leaks, and government prying.

## Terminology and Principles for Managing Personal Data
**Informed consent and invisible information gathering.**
**Secondary use**, the use of personal information for a purpose other than the one for which the person supplied it.
- Data mining, analyzing masses of data to find patterns and develop new information or knowledge.
- Matching, combining and comparing information from different databases, often using an identifier.
- Profiling, analyzing data to determine characteristics of people most likely to engage in certain behavior.
Give people some control over secondary uses, i.e. providing opt-in and opt-out.
**Fair information practices**, what if the government wants your customer's data? plan ahead, do you want to challenge subpoenas, give, or inform customer? The entities that hold the data have a responsibility to those people.
- Inform people when you collect information about them, what you collect, and how you use it.
- Collect only the data needed.
- Offer a way people to opt-out
- Keep data only as long as needed.
- Maintain accuracy of data.
- Protect security of data (from theft and accidental leaks), provide stronger protection for sensitive data.
- Develop policies for responding to law enforcement requests for data.


## Noninvasive but Deeply Revealing Searches
- Particle sniffers that detect many specific drugs and explosives 
- Imaging systems that detects guns under clothing from a distance
- Devices that analyze the molecular composition of cargo truck without opening the truck
- Thermal-imaging to find heat lamps for growing marijuana

These devices have obvious valuable security and law enforcement, but the technologies can be used for random searches, without search warrants or probable cause, on unsuspecting people.

## Video Surveillance and Face Recognition
Cameras alone raise some privacy issues, when combined with face recognition they raise even more.

England was the first country to set up large number cameras in public to deter crime. However based on study, there are number of abuses by operators of surveillance including collecting salacious footage, such as people having sex in a car, and showing it to colleagues. But later that year, photos taken by surveillance cameras helped identify terrorists who set off bombs in the London subway.

## Chapter 4: Intellectual Property
### Copyright
**Copyright**: legal concept that defines right to certain kinds of intellectual property. It protects creative works: books, articles, plays, songs (music and lyrics), works of art, movies, software, and videos. Facts, ideas, concepts, processes, and methods of operation are not copyrightable.

> When we buy a novel in book form, we are buying a physical collection of paper and ink. When we buy a novel as an ebook, we are buying certain rights to an electronic-book file. We are not buying the intellectual property.

The owner of physical book may: give away, lend, or resell.
The owner of physical book may not: make copies (with some exceptions). The legal right to copy belongs to the copyright owner.

U.S. copyright law (Title 17 of the U.S. Code 1 ) gives the copyright holder the
following exclusive rights, with some very important exceptions that we will describe:
- To make copies of the work
- To produce derivative works, such as translations into other languages or movies based on books
- To distribute copies
- To perform the work in public (e.g., music, plays)
- To display the work in public (e.g., artwork, movies, computer games, video on a website)

> The value of a painting is higher than the cost of the canvas and paint used to create it.

Copyrights last for a limited time - generally the lifetime of the author plus 70 years. After that, the work is in **public domain**.

### Challenge
Technological factors:
1. The ease of copying digitized material.
2. Inexpensive storage media.
3. Compression formats make music and movie small enough to be downloaded, copied, and stored.
4. Search engines.
5. Peer-to-peer technology.
6. High speed internet.
7. Miniaturization of cameras enable audience to record and transmit movies and sports events.
8. Video manipulation software, enabling non-professionals to create new works using the works of others.

> The content industries claim that about one-quarter of internet traffic worldwide consists of copyright-infringing material.

### Fair Use
**Definition**: allows uses of copyrighted material that contribute to the creation of new work (such as quoting part of a work in review) and uses that are not likely to deprive authors or publishers of income for their work. Fair use do not require the permission of the copyright holder.

Four factors to consider in determining whether a particular use is a fair use:
1. The purpose of the use, commercial use is less likely to be fair use.
2. The nature of the copyrighted work, creative work, such as novel, is less likely than use of factual work to be fair use.
3. The amount and significance of the portion used.
4. The effect of the use on potential market of copyrighted work.


### Study Case

**Sony vs Universal City Studios (1984)**
Because some customers used its Betamax video cassette recording to record movies shown on television.

The Court said that private, noncommercial uses should be presumed fair unless there is realistic likelihood of economic harm to the copyright holder.

On the issue of the legitimacy of the Betamax machine, the Court said makers of a device with substantial legal uses should not be penalized because some people use it to infringe copyright.

**Reverse engineering: game machines**
First case is Sega vs Accolade. Accolade made their games run properly by figuring out how part of Sega's game-machine software worked. Accolade copied Sega's program and decompiled it. Accolade won because Accolade's activity was fitting the purpose of fair use, encourage production of new creative work. The fact that Accolade was a commercial entity was not critical. ALthough Accolade's games might reduce the market for Sega's games, that was fair competition. Accolade was not selling copies of Sega's games.

Second case, Atari Games vs Nintendo, the court also ruled that making copies of program for reverse engineering was not copyright infringement. It is a fair "research" use.

Thrid case, Connectix copied Sony's PlayStation BIOS and reverse engineered it to develop software that emulates the PlayStation console. Game players could then buy the Connectix program and paly PlayStation games on their computer sithout buying the PlayStation console. Connectix's program did not contain anyo of Sony;s code and it was a new product. The copying of the BIOS was fair use.

**Sharing music: the Napster case**
Napster was MP3 sharing service, most of songs they traded without authorization. The court said it was copyright infringement.

Was the copying and distribution of music by Napster users legal under the fair use guidelines?
If not, was Napster responsible for the actions of its users?

Even though the copies were for personal, not commercial. Personal meant very limited use, i.e. within a household - not trading with thousands of strangers.

the Digital Millennium Copyright Act protected it from responsibility for copyright
violations by its users. The record companies argued that the law requires companies to make an effort to prevent copyright violations and that Napster did not take sufficient steps to eliminate unauthorized songs or users who committed violations.

**User interfaces**
In the 1980, 1990s, some companies won copyright infringement suits against others whose software had similar look and feel. But the trend of these court decisions has been against copyright protection for "look and feel". Courts ruled that: overlapping windows, pull-down menus, and common operations are outside the scope of copyright to encourage innovation.

> Programmers do not have to "reinvent the wheel", when designing a new interface.


## Response to Copyright Infringement
In a free society, which should win: the freedom of people to develop and use tools for legal purposes, or the prevention of potential crimes?

**Safe harbor** provisions of the DMCA(Digital Millenium Copyright Act) protect websites form lawsuits for copyright infringement when users post infringin material.
- The site operators must make a good-faith attempt to keep infringing material off their sites.
- They must remove such material when asked to do so by copyright owners.
- It recognized that websites operators could not review everything members post.

**DRM** (Digital Rights Management) the access control to prevent unauthorized use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted works. 

**Evolving business model**, as DRM was ineffective against piracy, In 2007 - 2009 many publishers began selling music without DRM. Some entertainment and Web content-sharing sites negotiate contracts for the site to pay a share of its ad revenue to the entertainment companies. This may allow users to post entertainment company material without the overhead and legal liability for getting permissions. The technical details

**Free Software**, supported by computer programmers who allow and encourage people to use, copy, and modify their software.

To enforce openness and sharing, they provides copyright protection called *copyleft* which makes any project developed from copylefted programs, must have same copyleft (free to use, modify, and distribute). Copyleft was developed by GNU (GNU Not Unix) and implemented using the name of GPL (GNU General Public License).

**Patents** differs from copyrights, they protect the invention not just a particular expression or implementation of it.
