# Figures, Tables, and Reference Management

## Quality of Academic Thesis or Scientific Manuscript
- Improving quality of presentation is easier than doing research
- If your manuscript is carelessly crafted, reviewers will think that your research is unacceptable for publication

**Quality of presentation**, after you doing your research, in written form or verbal form. People see quality of research based on quality of presentation.

## Tables vs Figures
Tips on choosing:
**Tables**
- If you want to present detailed data or compare to the other.
- The caption or subtitle located above the table

**Figures**
- If you want to deliver pattern.
- Explain the whole story.
- Captions are located below the figures and tables to help reader to understand.

## Tables
**Tables**
Use only two horizontal lines for the header and one horizontal lines for the footer. Don't use too many grid. Define the metric or unit.

Appropriate table

Example of Inappropriate table
No unit specified.

Too many grids

## Figures
Good figures support your discussion
- Present the theory or generalization that you found in Result section.
- Discussion errors, exception, or outliers in the Results
- Discuss any issue that is unsolved by your results (limitations of your work).
- Compare and contrast your result with previous works
- Answering your hypothesis stated in Chapter 2
- Discussing implication of your Results towards your society or existing theories in your field
- Self-contained figure
	- Readers do not have to refer the text to understand the figures.
	- Informative caption.
	- Originality is the main concern.
	- Avoid redundancy.

Types of figures:
1. Primary evidence, electron micrograph, photograph, X-rays, pathology slides, experimental setup
2. Graphs: line graphs, bar graphs, scatter plots, histogram, boxplot.
3. Drawing and diagrams: Illustrating of experimental setup, indicating flow of participants, giving a hypothetical model, illustrating cause and effect relationship, representing microscopic organisms as cartoons.

**Primary evidence**

**Drawing and diagram**
Figures support story telling, i.e.
Redraw figure to conceptual diagram of DNA, you will be confused with the primary evidence picture.

**Graph**
Column or bar graphs.
Appropriate to present values of continuous data or discrete items or categories
- If both continuous, use line graph
Axis for continuous variable should start a zero.
 - Length of bar indicates values.
 - Don't artificially manipulate lengths.
Don;t let maximum value for continuous variable go higher than it is theoretically able to.
 - i.e. don't exceed 100%

Good Graph
Include std error and std deviation
The axis is clear

**Pie Chart** for percentage data.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210930153620.png)
- If all parts add up to 100 percent.
	- To account for all cases you can add an "other" category.
- Minimize number of segments (4-5 segments is okay using pie chart)
- Include percentage and label for each segment.

**Stacked Bar Graphs** just like pie chart, if each item in a series have to add up to 100%
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210930133234.png)
- If you have a lot of categories, you can use stacked bar graphs. But minimize number of segments in each bar, more than three can be difficult to interpret.
- Make use of color coding conventions that audiences is likely to be familiar with. In US - green is good, yellow is marginal, and red is bad.


Notes:
- All figures and tables must be referred to from the text. Use sentences that draw reader's attention.
- Abbreviation of the word "Figure", When referring to a figure in the text, the word "Figure" is abbreviated as "Fig" (except on the beginning of descriptive sentence), while "Table" is not abbreviated. 
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210930133748.png)
- Number the tables and figures, Figures and Tables are numbered independently, in the sequence. If in revision, you change the presentation sequence of the figures and tables, you must renumber them to reflect the new sequence.

Example 1:
Too large scale, you can't see the data in first figure.

Example 2:
Too large scale, disruptive legend position, not standarized fonts (type and size).

Example 3:
Not standarized font size and type.

Example 4:
Readers can't see the trend or pattern with first table.

Example 5:
Too many grid lines, no description about small and large.

Example 6:
The caption is too simple.

## Checklist of Scientific Figures
- Design: type, shape and layout.
- Size: Make sure that all information

**Read a good paper and observe how other researchers present their data through figures and tables**

## Reference Management
Invalid references (You can use them, but don't write them in your thesis and proposal):
- Wikipedia
- Medium or non-peer-reviewed blog articles
- Unpublished reports or personal communications.

**Citation Style**
Use IEEE for your thesis in UGM.

In Elsevier:
For Zotero and Mendeley download citation as RIS
For JabRef in Latex, you can use BibTex

Sometimes you need to cleanup the informttion, i.e. you don;t need DDI or URL to construct IEEE citation.
