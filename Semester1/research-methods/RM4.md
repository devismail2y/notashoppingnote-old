## Scientific Contribution
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210910154306.png)
You have to expand your skills hugely to contribute in scientific journal.

There is overlapping in electrical, information, and biomedical. So you will find similarity when reading them.
- Working on old problem with improved method (improvement-type research, contribution in method), by improve accuracy using improved method for example. Usually you need to compare your method to previous methods. Best for starting in research. If you need, you can search paper with code, to recreate the experiments.
- The most prevalent type is implementing old method to solve new problem (contribution in problem). Usually if you work together with people in multidisciplinary area.
- Implementing new method to new problem, you have to find a baseline or step stone.
- Proofing a theoretical model with real implementation in hardware. I.e. adjusting well known algorithm to run in embedded system, because of resource limitation, you need to modify the old implementation.
- Development of **low-cost** method with equal performance of existing method. This is money, if researchers in company find this, usually they don't publish this finding.

Darwin Research, for example

## Citation Index and Databases
**Citation index** indexes the citations an article makes, linking the article with cited works. Designed for literature search for researchers to find subsequent articles that cite a given article. Such as:

**Coverage vs Quality**
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210910160547.png)

Web of Science has the narrowest coverage because they have strict regulations to index scientific journals.

On the other hand, Google scholar index everything that has abstract, introduction, method, and conclusion without filter.

Be careful, some predatory journal also indexed by Scopus. Don't read anything from this as it doesn't have peer review before and has low quality.

## Impact Factor
Average citation per article during a particular period of publications (normally 2 years or 5 years)

For example, 
A = the number of times article published in 2019 and 2018 cited in indexed journals during 2020.

B = the number of citable items (e.g. technical papers, review papers, but not editorials and letters-to-the-Editor) published in 2019 and 2018.

The 2020 impact factor = A/B

The example is moderate impact factor. The wider audiences, the higher impact factor usually journals in these areas mathematics, physics, etc.

**How to check impact factor**

## Scimago Journal Rank
Alternative of impact factor, freely available at https://scimagojr.com

calculated by Scopus citation, but there is no self-citations. So generally the score is lower than impact factor

## Journal Quartile 
Rank of the journal in the multiple specific area/category.

![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210910163323.png)
Q1 = green color (top 25%)
Q2 = yellow
Q3 = orange
Q4 = red

## Best Practices to Identify Suitable References

plus https://thinkchecksubmit.org to check whether it predatory or not.

Every journal listed on the step 1, can be guaranteed as great resources, because it passed peer review before.

You should only read high quality paper, so you will get great standard on your writing.

Open article has APC (Article Processing Charge), maybe $1000 - $6000.
**Beware of predatory journal**
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210910163814.png)
1. The gmail domain
2. Some claims that indexed by a lot of indexing list
3. Strange promises that they will give author notification within 4-6 after submissions. The real review will take a lot of time.

**Beware of predatory publisher**
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210910164200.png)
1. High acceptance rates
2. They sends you an un-solicited invitation to submit an article for publication
3. Minimal peer review
4. Little attention to digital preservation, good publisher will preserve your article for 100-200 years even though the company goes bankrupt.
5. Not necessarily indexed in electronic databases
6. Journals may be short lived
7. No archiving policy

Types of predatory journals:

**Phisher:** such journals entice the author with promises of fast printing, but later charge high fees that were not mentioned either on the journal page or when the article was uploaded.

**Hijacker:** these are journals that try to look like well-known publishers, but there are additional words in their titles, such as “international”, “reviews,” and et cetera. Hijackers usually have web pages that are very similar in design and web address.

**Trojan Horse:** these are journals that have a well-ordered website, often an impressive list of journals and articles, but in reality, such articles either do not exist or worse they are either stolen or plagiarized.

**Unicorn:** these are publishers who may be legitimate businesses, but they do not follow any recommendations for publishers, which could lead to ethical violations, an imperfect quality peer-review process, or a lack of archiving policies (article may disappear at any time).

## Steps of Academic Research
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210910164919.png)

Reading skill level
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210910164949.png)

Magister level, you should read 70-200 papers.

**Strategy to read research paper**
As master student, in sequence
1. Abstract
2. Result, figures and tables
3. Discussion, interpretation of result
4. Result in text.
5. Introduction
6. Methods, in case you are very interested with the context, you can read this section.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210910165511.png)

If you create papers, the figures, tables results should be self-sufficient and self-contained.

**Reading Technical Papers Sequence**
1. Date of publication -> less than 5 years. You can read older papers for analysis but not for explaining the contribution.
2. Read the abstract
3. Read the keywords
4. Read the introduction
5. Read the conclusion
6. Observe the figures, tables, and results

Finally, ask yourself, is this paper is key papers (relevant) or not? If it is very relevant, you should keep it to explain the novelty of your research.

**Speed Reading**
1. Title and abstract: big picture of the paper and research gap
2. Conclusions, figures, and tables: major finding of the paper.
3. Date of publication: whether the papers are new (<5years)

5 Parts of abstract, you can find the relevancy.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210910170046.png)

**Categorize your references**
- Not relevant but widening your knowledge in your field, use speed reading and stop, You may need these papers later in discussion section of your publication.
- Highly relevant (key papers), use speed reading and continue with deep reading, these are papers that construct mostly direction of your research.

**Deep reading**, read and analyze the paper

## Identifying Research Gap
Scientific gap is the things that haven't been found in your key paper.

Comparative table for finding research gap

Example
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210910170707.png)

Research gap should fulfill two criterias
1. Extracted from previously published works : not more than 5 years prior to submission, preferably published in reputable journals.
2. The gap is important to be solved, explain the implication (impact of your work toward your field) in the introduction section if you can solve the problem.
