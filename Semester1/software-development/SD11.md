# Modern Requirement Engineering
Everything starts with market intents, the problems, and regulations.

Requirement should have multiple point of view.

Layers in requirement engineering:
- Business level (A level) - not technical things, its all about the business
	- business requirements
	- business rule

- User level (B level) - requirement that elaborate/gathered from the user.
	- User requirements
	- Quality attributes -> performance of products, etc

- Development team point of view (C level) - most technical aspect
	- System requirements -> i.e. Linux, Windows, SQL Oracle, MySQL
	- Functional requirements -> the user requirement implemented technically, i.e. search bar, login sequence, search history
	- External interfaces -> gateway of communication between solutions, i.e. if the client's company has SSO, using OAuth.
	- Constraints -> limitation

Requirement Management vs Requirement Development
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020211208084101.png)

Elicitation Development -> developing the requirement together
- interview -> a client as source of the information and experts 
- facilitated group meeting (fgd)-> using hands-on document as part of discussion -> a lot of person
- observation -> observe how it works, analyze problem, and develop requirement
- questionnaires -> a lot of bias, but you get a lot of feedback
- prototyping/workshop -> to give idea to customer about your solution using clickable mock up and seeking the feedback from customer.
- scenario analysis -> when customer has previous system, user manual, or regulations that need to be improved or obeyed by your system. Less or no communication with the customer.
	- system
	- user interface
	- document

**Example**
Self recruitment platform of company: 
- interview or questionnaire to the end user
- FGD with the HR
- prototyping

Verbatim record -> the original/raw material -> i.e. videos from the recording, audio of the recording. It should be classified analysis:
- business requirement 
- user requirements
- business rules
- functional requirements
- quality attributes
- external interface
- constraints
- data requirements
- solution ideas

This is stored by the business analyst

Ambiguity of the requirement -> clarify it to customer

Requirement priority -> stated by the customer
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020211208091322.png)

1. essential
2. add business value
3. nice to have

Specification result

Technical approaches
- use case
- user story


Functional requirement

Validating requirements
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020211208092016.png)

From up to bottom
1. Acceptance testing with the users -> not guided by the testers
2. System testingwith the users -> guided by the testers
3. Integration testing - with the testers
4. Unit testing - with the developers

Reviewing requirements
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020211208092445.png)

- Peer desk check: send and review.
- Pass around: DIstribute document and get some feedback from the customer, and pass it to manager or sponsor (multiple approval).
- Walkthrough: discuss together about the features with the customer.
