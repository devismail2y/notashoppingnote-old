# UI and UX

## User Experience
Related to user satisfaction with the product.

Platt's first law about UX:
Know the user, for he is not they (personalization = easy to the customer) 
- makes your user happier or more productive
- solve a specific problem or pleasure
- pleasurable state as quickly as they can and stay there as long as they can

Google:
- Google detects your location by using IP and provide user with the corresponding language.
- You can do calculation on the search bar
- Vanilla design, is not so good on user interface, but it is good on user experience

**Study case**
Giving options, but not really essentials.

UX = feel the products
CX = feel the brands
(customer experience)

### Persona
When we create a product, we should have the definition of the users itself (persona)
- who will be the users
- what degree of knowledge

Understanding user = creating persona (fictious, specific, concrete representations of target users)

Persona is NOT an actor on a use case
- Persona focused on scenario (how I do that)
- Actor focused on responsibility (what can I do)

Persona:
- assumptions of the behaviour of each user(people who love adding item to cart, people who often wishlisting items, people who only look at the product without doing anything).
- allows you to focus and design the specific users, to make better decision.
- your system create empathy to the user

Steps to create persona
- understand the users with research and statistics
- examine themes and patterns when doing something
- create individual character who use the product
- create the character with biographical information

Data source to persona development
- user testing
- analytics
- customer data
- customer surveys
- social media
- feedback

Example

Usage of Persona
- design
- strategy and priority
- content creation
- evaluation

### Information Architecture (IA)
Create useful information that displayed into the app. A good IA will allow people to find what they want with less effort.

Persona tells about the 'user' but what they need about the app?
- Fulfill and understand the scenario and activity of the users
- Solving a problem of the user as quickly as possible supported by the information on the application.

Benefits:
- Requirements engineering
- Designing process
- Planning content
	- Pages
	- Navigation
	- Structures
	- Search experiences

Example: IA for flickr

- how the information is distributed
- specification of the information

Example: IA using sitemap

Steps to design IA:
- Conduct customer research (UX research and user profile)
- Update and review the content (content inventory and audit)
- Apply card sorting for content classification (card sorting activity)
- Build a user-friendly hierarchy (navigation and labeling, site mapping)
- Create a UI prototype (wireframing)

## User Interface
Development
- Pencils before pixels
- Wireframing
- Prototyping
- Testing User Interfaces

UI = how to hack your vision: better UI means low brain activity in term of user vision

Hackvision types"
- central vision (high brain activity)
- peripheral vision (low brain activity)
- visually scan (highest brain activity)

Good UI
- create whitespace
- grouping information
- alignment the UI (i.e. same left alignment level)
- attention (focus, keep UI simple, create movement)
- color choice
- building UI using mind vision (better UI means low brain activity to use the product)
	- leading information (instructional text, onboarding overlay, wizard)
	- ![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020211123111430.png)
	- recall (extracting something from your memory) vs recognition (related with how you understand the meanings of something)
		- recall used for something you want to be more productive, i.e. using SUM formula in Excel.
		- recognition used to visually tells the user about something to understand the content. i.e. save button that described by floppy disk image.

- Progressive (advanced options)

- Status (progress bar)

## Conclusion
- Building UX can be done by following
	- Persona development
	- Information architecture development
	- UI development

- UI, UX, and CX to build "killer apps"

- UI design recommendation
	- Hack vision strategy
	- Mind vision strategy'


If you build a software you can copyright certain parts
- intellectual property (maybe specific UI and UX interaction, patterns)
- you cant use studied structure as intellectual property, because it becomes standard. (i.e. flash sale location in website, popup message about flash sale)
