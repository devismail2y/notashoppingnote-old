## Question 1
You are a teacher. You would like your students to use a course package in MOOC, but the school’s budget does not include enough money to buy copies for all the students. Your school is in a poor neighborhood, and you know most of the parents cannot afford to buy the software for their children.

**List some ways you could try to obtain the software without making unauthorized copies.**
1.  Check whether your desired course is available for free. Usually MOOCs are freemium. For example, you can freely join, but you must pay a certain amount of money to get the certificate.
2.  Check for other free resources with similar topics.
3.  Contact the creator of the course, explain the reason you need it.
    
** Suppose the methods you try do not work. Will you copy the software or decide not to use it? Give some arguments for and against your position. Explain why you think the arguments on your side are stronger.**
I will copy and distribute the MOOC to students. In this case I complete all of four factors to consider whether the course is fair use.
1.  It is not for commercial use.
2.  MOOCs are most likely factual works.
3.  I redistribute a course package, not the whole course. 
4.  There is no effect of the use on the potential market of copyrighted work, because the students can not afford the course.

But there is a negative consequence for this act: Students can redistribute the course publicly, or even commercialize it. This is an obvious copyright infringement. However, the teacher can tackle these problem with: 
1.  Tell the students briefly about copyright.
2.  Disclaimers to letting the student know the reason not to redistribute.
3.  On-site class with no recording device allowed.
4.  Teacher does not share the course package online even in cloud storage.

## Question 2

A search engine company copies millions of books in a university library, including course material in MOOC in the public domain and course material in MOOC still protected by copyright. It displays segments—say, a paragraph—in response to user search requests.  

**Analyze how the fair use guidelines apply to this practice for the material in MOOC still covered by copyright.**
Copying and caching is essential to the service of search engines in order to briefly describe the content of the MOOC. The process is fully automated by using crawler. Two of fair use factors are completed.
1.  MOOCs are most likely factual works.  
2.  Only small amounts of the excerpts displayed by search engines. Caching involves copying entire web pages, but the court ruled that caching web pages is a fair use. 

Search engines may also index the pirated content of MOOCs which are published by other web services. This fall into safe harbour, as long as the search engine company committed to support copyright holders by keeping infringing materials off their search results.

**Should the copying and display be considered fair use, or should the company need permission from the copyright holders? (If you think the ethically right decision differs from the decision that follows from applying the fair use guidelines, explain how and why.)**
It depends on two factors:
1.  Is it commercialized? Some search engines have commercial purposes.   
2.  Do you have any income for the copyright holder caused by indexing in search engines?  

Search engine companies might need to negotiate contracts with major copyright holders, for these reasons.
1.  Legal and ethical reasons
2.  How they can benefit each other. 
    
## Question 3

A MOOC developer can modify a chapter in MOOC by adding or deleting a few subchapters in MOOC without getting permission or paying a royalty to the person who developed the chapter in MOOC.

Give an example of modiﬁcations of a professional song or a piece of software that is analogous to a MOOC developer using the chapter in MOOC.  
Work between the song publisher and the artists, the song publisher may not include some lyrics which were created by the artists.

**Do you think your example satisﬁes the fair use guidelines? That is, is it very likely courts would consider it a legal fair use? Explain why.**
It is fair use because they work together to publish the copyrighted content and gain benefits from the contents. To be certain, they need to negotiate a contract beforehand and communicate with each other in the process of publishing.

**Copyright protects topics in MOOCs. A court would likely ﬁnd that selling a topic in MOOC in which many of the chapter in MOOCs are slight modiﬁcations of chapter in MOOCs in someone’s else’s topic in MOOC is copyright infringement. Give an example of modiﬁcations of a professional song or a piece of software that is analogous to selling such a topic in MOOC.**

In Youtube, if your content contains section in copyrighted music, it will be considered as copyright infringement and your videos will be taken down. If you get three copyright strike, your account will be banned.
