Characteristics of ICS

Because of IOT, oil fields, pipelines, and refineries are vulnerable to cyber attacks (internal or external), impact: safety, production failure, and commercial risk. 

ICS are typically designed to fail safe, but cyber attack is more and more sophisticated.

### Based on O&G Value Chain
**Upstream**
Exploration (geophysical evaluation & design, field development, and drilling operations)
Risk: Misappropriation of commercially sensitive reservoir performance and well data -> damage to the operator's competitive position in play or field

Production (bringing the oil to the surface)
Risk: Equipment safety and control -> operational shutdown, financial loss, safety incidents.

**Midstream**
Transportation (via pipelines or truck)
Risk1: manipulation of pipelines system -> explosion, spillage, environmental damage, and unsafe conditions for personnel and adjacent populations
Risk2: Disruption of monitoring equipment -> shutdown of system for investigation, missed shipment, financial loss

**Downstream**
Refining (processing of crude oil into petroleum products, product blending)
Risk: theft of inventory data on crude oil and refined products -> failure to meet business commitments and reputation damage

Marketing (retailing and trading)
Disruption or tampering with operational controls -> unsafe operating conditions, downtime, supply disruption, revenue loss.

### Risks
Digitization of operational process in the O&G industry has led to new opportunities to improve productivity and to drive down costs. However, the convergence of operational and business systems has also opened the enterprise to a whole new array of cyber risks.

1. Insecure remote access communication
2. Poor security practices by a third-party contractor
3. Improper testing of IT systems
4. Technology acquired directly by a facility without adequate testing and evaluation
5. Lack of security awareness

### Maturity Assessment
1. Conduct an inventory assessment of assets and facilities and rank them in terms of critically
2. Determine if critical assets and facilities have well-known and exploitable vulnerabilities
3. Assess the maturity of the controls environment for proactively managing these threats

### Build a Unified Program
To prevent digital disruption
**Secure**
Preventing system compromises through automated controls and monitoring.

**Vigilant**
Continuous monitoring to determine that a system is still secure or has been compromised.

**Resilient**
Has the plans and procedures in place to identify, contain, and neutralize cyber attack in order to restore normal operations.

### Key Control
to achieve security, vigilance, and resiliency

- Awareness training
- Access control of ICS components
- Network security
- Restriction of portable media through ICS environment
- Incident response through developed policies and procedures + periodically tested

### Embrace Good Governance
1. There must be a single line of accountability
2. ICS security under the auspices of CISO
3. Create a clear career path
4. Develop an awareness program to bridge the gap between IT and ICS professional.
