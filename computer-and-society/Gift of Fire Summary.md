This is a summary

## Chapter 4: Intellectual Property
### Copyright
**Copyright**: legal concept that defines right to certain kinds of intellectual property. It protects creative works: books, articles, plays, songs (music and lyrics), works of art, movies, software, and videos. Facts, ideas, concepts, processes, and methods of operation are not copyrightable.

> When we buy a novel in book form, we are buying a physical collection of paper and ink. When we buy a novel as an ebook, we are buying certain rights to an electronic-book file. We are not buying the intellectual property.

The owner of physical book may: give away, lend, or resell.
The owner of physical book may not: make copies (with some exceptions). The legal right to copy belongs to the copyright owner.

U.S. copyright law (Title 17 of the U.S. Code 1 ) gives the copyright holder the
following exclusive rights, with some very important exceptions that we will describe:
- To make copies of the work
- To produce derivative works, such as translations into other languages or movies based on books
- To distribute copies
- To perform the work in public (e.g., music, plays)
- To display the work in public (e.g., artwork, movies, computer games, video on a website)

> The value of a painting is higher than the cost of the canvas and paint used to create it.

Copyrights last for a limited time - generally the lifetime of the author plus 70 years. After that, the work is in **public domain**.

### Challenge
Technological factors:
1. The ease of copying digitized material.
2. Inexpensive storage media.
3. Compression formats make music and movie small enough to be downloaded, copied, and stored.
4. Search engines.
5. Peer-to-peer technology.
6. High speed internet.
7. Miniaturization of cameras enable audience to record and transmit movies and sports events.
8. Video manipulation software, enabling non-professionals to create new works using the works of others.

> The content industries claim that about one-quarter of internet traffic worldwide consists of copyright-infringing material.

### Fair Use
**Definition**: allows uses of copyrighted material that contribute to the creation of new work (such as quoting part of a work in review) and uses that are not likely to deprive authors or publishers of income for their work. Fair use do not require the permission of the copyright holder.

Four factors to consider in determining whether a particular use is a fair use:
1. The purpose of the use, commercial use is less likely to be fair use.
2. The nature of the copyrighted work, creative work, such as novel, is less likely than use of factual work to be fair use.
3. The amount and significance of the portion used.
4. The effect of the use on potential market of copyrighted work.


### Study Case

**Sony vs Universal City Studios (1984)**
Because some customers used its Betamax video cassette recording to record movies shown on television.

The Court said that private, noncommercial uses should be presumed fair unless there is realistic likelihood of economic harm to the copyright holder.

On the issue of the legitimacy of the Betamax machine, the Court said makers of a device with substantial legal uses should not be penalized because some people use it to infringe copyright.

**Reverse engineering: game machines**
First case is Sega vs Accolade. Accolade made their games run properly by figuring out how part of Sega's game-machine software worked. Accolade copied Sega's program and decompiled it. Accolade won because Accolade's activity was fitting the purpose of fair use, encourage production of new creative work. The fact that Accolade was a commercial entity was not critical. ALthough Accolade's games might reduce the market for Sega's games, that was fair competition. Accolade was not selling copies of Sega's games.

Second case, Atari Games vs Nintendo, the court also ruled that making copies of program for reverse engineering was not copyright infringement. It is a fair "research" use.

Thrid case, Connectix copied Sony's PlayStation BIOS and reverse engineered it to develop software that emulates the PlayStation console. Game players could then buy the Connectix program and paly PlayStation games on their computer sithout buying the PlayStation console. Connectix's program did not contain anyo of Sony;s code and it was a new product. The copying of the BIOS was fair use.

**Sharing music: the Napster case**
Napster was MP3 sharing service, most of songs they traded without authorization. The court said it was copyright infringement.

Was the copying and distribution of music by Napster users legal under the fair use guidelines?
If not, was Napster responsible for the actions of its users?

Even though the copies were for personal, not commercial. Personal meant very limited use, i.e. within a household - not trading with thousands of strangers.

the Digital Millennium Copyright Act protected it from responsibility for copyright
violations by its users. The record companies argued that the law requires companies to make an effort to prevent copyright violations and that Napster did not take sufficient steps to eliminate unauthorized songs or users who committed violations.

**User interfaces**
In the 1980, 1990s, some companies won copyright infringement suits against others whose software had similar look and feel. But the trend of these court decisions has been against copyright protection for "look and feel". Courts ruled that: overlapping windows, pull-down menus, and common operations are outside the scope of copyright to encourage innovation.

> Programmers do not have to "reinvent the wheel", when designing a new interface.


## Response to Copyright Infringement
In a free society, which should win: the freedom of people to develop and use tools for legal purposes, or the prevention of potential crimes?

**Safe harbor** provisions of the DMCA(Digital Millenium Copyright Act) protect websites form lawsuits for copyright infringement when users post infringin material.
- The site operators must make a good-faith attempt to keep infringing material off their sites.
- They must remove such material when asked to do so by copyright owners.
- It recognized that websites operators could not review everything members post.

**DRM** (Digital Rights Management) the access control to prevent unauthorized use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted works. 

**Evolving business model**, as DRM was ineffective against piracy, In 2007 - 2009 many publishers began selling music without DRM. Some entertainment and Web content-sharing sites negotiate contracts for the site to pay a share of its ad revenue to the entertainment companies. This may allow users to post entertainment company material without the overhead and legal liability for getting permissions. The technical details
