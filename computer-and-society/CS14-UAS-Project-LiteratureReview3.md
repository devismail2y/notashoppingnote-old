# Cyber-Attacks on the Oil & Gas Sector: A Survey on Incident Assessment and Attack Patterns
This research correlate with MITRE ATT&CK Framework

SCADA system usually apply to diverse systems and components

Cyber-Physical System (CPS) computer system in which a mechanism is controlled or monitored by computer-based algorithm. CPS is similar to IoT, sharing the basic architecture, nevertheless, CPS presents a higher combination and coordination between physical and computational elements. I.e. smart grid, autonomous mobile, medical monitoring, ICS, robotics systems, and automatic pilot.
