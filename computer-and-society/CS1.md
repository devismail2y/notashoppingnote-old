# The Hook Model

## Challenge of Creating New Products
The product creators hope that their products/services become the part of user's habit. Sign that a product become user's habit:
- Users do not realize when using the product/service.
- Users automatically use the product/service as the part of daily habit.
- Users do not feel complete, if they do not use the product/service.

So you need to connect users' problem to your solution with enough frequency to make it a habit.

## The Hook Canvas

### 1. Trigger
What motivates user to use products/services?

There is 2 types of trigger:
1. External: the source comes explicitly from outside of user him/herself. This trigger contains message that the user needs to do next. I.e. 
    - Social media notification
    - Email notification
    - Discount event in e-commerce.
2. Internal: the source come implicitly from the user. Message from him/herself that associates with user's memory. I.e. 
	- Seminar discussion that triggers conversation about research. 
	- Loneliness that triggers social media activity

A great product design must triggers internal association with the users. This design will cause an internal motivation to use the product.

The most effective internal trigger is negative emotion.

### 2. Action (Behaviour)
What users do when they expect certain rewards?

Example:
1. Scroll down the social media to see other users' posts.
2. Click certain button to play the video.

The user persuation to do actions can be modelled with formula created by B.J. Frogg.

- Motivation: how big the motivation to do something?
	- Anticipatory: looking for hopes and prevent worriness.
	- Sensational: looking for happiness and prevent uncomfortability.
	- Social: looking for social proof and prevent rejection

- Ability: User's capacity to do specific activity. This variable can be enlarged by convenience

### 3. Variable Rewards
What users' expect after doing action?

When designing product/service reward anticipation is more important than the reward itself. A part of human brain (nucleus accumbens) becomes active when they are expecting rewards, then it is less active when the reward is gained.

This step's purpose is to give reward which expected by the users, furthermore making them to hope for more rewards.

Human tends to be challenged to know about something mysterious, this can bring up focus and engagement to certain product. Constantly create rewards and when the user receive them without explicitly tell them, may make them to keep focusing and engaging.

### 4. Investments
What can you give to keep users in the cycle?

Example:
1. Replying comments in your social media
2. Follow back

## Conclusion
To design a great product/service, you have to ask yourself about
1. What internal trigger does your product address?
2. What external trigger prompts the next action?
3. With the anticipation of reward, what is the simplest behaviour users can do?
4. Is the reward fulfilling and leaves the user wanting more?
5. What is the bit of work to increase the likelihood of the next pass through the hook cycle?
