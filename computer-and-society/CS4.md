# Plagiarism, Fair Use, and Copyright Laws

## Copyright
**Definition**: legal right granted to an author, composer, playwright, publisher, or distributor to exclusive publication, production, sale, or distribution of literary, musical, dramatic, or artistic work.

Copyright gives the creators the right to decide about how their work can be used, including :
- Whether copies can be made and distributed.
- Public performances of their work staged.
- Derivative works, by adapting or altering original works.

Two exceptions to copyright are ==fair use and works== in the public domain.

**Fair use** is a concept in copyright law that allows limited use of copyright material without requiring permission from the rights holders.

Not all use of another person's work is considered to be ==copyright infringement==. I.e. using works for teaching, research, or criticism would typically fall under fair use and therefore be allowed under copyright laws. When determining if it is fair to use something, one must consider:
- the nature of the use(if it is for non profit purposes, it is more likely to be fair use than if it is to make money).
- the nature of the work itself (factual information is more likely to fall under fair use than creative works).
- the amount and significance of the work to be used (using a small portion as opposed to a large portion of the work is more likely fair use).
- the effect of using the work on market (if the copyright owners will lose money by another person using their work, that would not be fair use).
- if the use is fair, people may then use another person's creative work - but they should remember to cite the work properly.

**Public domain** is material that is not copyrighted, whose copyright has expired, or is uncopyrightable (government publications, jokes, titles, and ideas). Currently, copyright laws are in effect for 70 years after the death of the creator of the work. 

## Copyright Violation
**Copyright violations** are equivalent to theft, both illegal and immoral. Proving there is no infringement can take time and effort. Why risk the penalties?

**Copyright infringement** is the unauthorized use of copyrighted material in a manner that violates one of the copyright owner's exclusive rights, such as the right to reproduce or perform the copyrighted work, or to make derivative works that build upon it.

**Plagiarism** is the uncredited use (both intentional and unintentional) of somebody else's words or ideas. In other words, the act of using someone else's work as your own is considered plagiarism.

When using information from the internet, it is important to be careful especially when using information that someone else has created. Individuals who create original works are protected by law.

If your work is for educational purposes, then use of copyrighted material falls under the "Fair Use" provision, which allows reasonable use of copyrighted work without permission (for research, criticism, and education).

A notice at the beginning or end of your production giving credit to copyright owners for their work is usually sufficient.

## Other Terms
**Copyright notice** is a one or two line statement that should be included in every article that includes the copyright symbol, date and owner.

**Open License** in terms of copyright, using the works of others, but crediting the original source.
