- attributes: features (capabilities of the software: be able to authenticate, be able to printout the report, etc), properties (numbers that can be measured in the software: line of code, deep of inheritances, numbers of classes)
- mapping: number (number of features, software complexity level) and symbol (green symbol for people with great productivity, etc)

Software metrics can be main ingredients for decision making: anomaly behavior, predictive analysis by using data driven decision making.
