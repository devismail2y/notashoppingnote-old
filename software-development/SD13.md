# Software Metrics

Software metrics is a measurement based technique that applied to software process, product, and services

**Purposes**:
- understanding
- control
- improvement

**Components**
- entity: objects -> software, process (waterfall, analysis design), people (productivity, time needed to build services), practices (feature development, devops)
- attributes: features (capabilities of the software: be able to authenticate, be able to printout the report, etc), properties (numbers that can be measured in the software: line of code, deep of inheritances, numbers of classes)
- mapping: number (number of features, software complexity level) and symbol (green symbol for people with great productivity, etc)

Software metrics can be main ingredients for decision making: anomaly behavior, predictive analysis by using data driven decision making.

**Benefits for multiple PoV:**
- Organization
	- more revenue
	- less process
	- low cost

- Project
	- withing budget
	- deliver the product on time

- Task
	- improving quality module
	- deliver less bug

**Variables**:
- Factor: a quality that we wish to base a decision on but that cannot be measured directly, using qualitative approach after that you should report it in quantitative measure. I.e. likert scale (asking user satisfaction level).
	- maintainability, complexity, usability

- Metric: something that can be measured
	- i.e. productivity: how many tasks per day? how many codes per hours?


**Measuring software metrics**
- Measurement: specific way to evaluate metric using units. I.e hours, days, line of codes, git commits,
- Validation: The metric is validated if it tells us something useful. This useful for data correlation -> comparing two of validated measurements, i.e. does the line code is align with developer productivity, does drinking coffee makes developers more productive rather than drinking tea. 


**Result**
- Correlation: if A happens, then B happens
- Causality: if A happens, then it causes B to happen.
- Predictability: if A happens, I can predict that B may be happen.

**Scope**
- cost and effort
- productivity
- quality of data collection
- quality models
- reliability
- performance
- architecture
- management
- evaluation
- capability maturity model
