# Software Metrics

Software metrics is a measurement based technique that applied to software process, product, and services

**Purposes**:
- understanding
- control
- improvement

**Components**
- entity: objects -> software, process (waterfall, analysis design), people (productivity, time needed to build services), practices (feature development, devops)
- attributes: features (capabilities of the software: be able to authenticate, be able to printout the report, etc), properties (numbers that can be measured in the software: line of code, deep of inheritances, numbers of classes)
- mapping: number (number of features, software complexity level) and symbol (green symbol for people with great productivity, etc)

Software metrics can be main ingredients for decision making: anomaly behavior, predictive analysis by using data driven decision making.

**Benefits for multiple PoV:**
- Organization
	- more revenue
	- less process
	- low cost

- Project
	- withing budget
	- deliver the product on time

- Task
	- improving quality module
	- deliver less bug

**Variables**:
- Factor: a quality that we wish to base a decision on but that cannot be measured directly, using qualitative approach after that you should report it in quantitative measure. I.e. likert scale (asking user satisfaction level).
	- maintainability, complexity, usability

- Metric: something that can be measured
	- i.e. productivity: how many tasks per day? how many codes per hours?


**Measuring software metrics**
- Measurement: specific way to evaluate metric using units. I.e hours, days, line of codes, git commits,
- Validation: The metric is validated if it tells us something useful. This useful for data correlation -> comparing two of validated measurements, i.e. does the line code is align with developer productivity, does drinking coffee makes developers more productive rather than drinking tea. 


**Result**
- Correlation: if A happens, then B happens
- Causality: if A happens, then it causes B to happen.
- Predictability: if A happens, I can predict that B may be happen.

**Scope**
- cost and effort
- productivity
- quality of data collection
- quality models
- reliability
- performance
- architecture
- management
- evaluation
- capability maturity model

**Common example**

**Scale types**
- Nominal: based on labelling, classifying
	- design classification, function classification

- Ordinal: based on level
	- priority  (0 (essentials), 1 (adding business value, 2 (nice to have))

- Interval: based on range
	- sentiment analysis from 0 to 10

- Ration: comparison between values
	- Just like in common example

- Absolutes: based on count of attributes
	- How many bugs found?

## Twelve Steps to Define Software Metrics
- Step 1: identify metrics customers
	- i.e. task level

- Step 2: target goals
	- i.e. improving software quality

- Step 3: ask questions
	- what to define software quality

- Step 4: select metrics
	- amount of bugs

- Step 5: standardized definitions
	- what is bugs? -> i.e. something that not expected by customers

- Step 6: choose a model
	- model to find the bug: user complaints, tester finding

- Step 7: establish counting criteria
	- bugs per iteration

- Step 8: decide on decision criteria
	- 38 average bugs based on the image
	- software quality score based on the counting, i.e. if lower than 38 bugs software quality is high, if more than 38 bugs the software quality is high

- Step 9: define reporting mechanism
	- dashboard? report? tables?

- Step 10: determine additional qualifiers

- Step 11: collect the data

- Step 12: consider human factors (optional)
	- total hours works per day

**Metrics objective statement template**

i.e.
To evaluate the defects found and corrected during testing in order to ensure all known defects are corrected before shipment.

**Never use metrics for**
- individual level (comparing between person)
- stick as a single of truth (using only one metric and trust it as a whole decision making ingredient)
- ignore the data

**Use metrics for**
- select metrics based on goal
- provide feedback
- focus in process, product, and services
- support the team i.e. to work in their capacity
