# Understanding SCRUM Framework
https://www.scrum.org

## What is Scrum
Scrum is implemented not only in software development, but also on project management.

Choose Scrum if the project management is harder than technical difficulty. 
1. Resource
2. Time
3. Multi-years project
4. Multiple stakeholders

Scrum is the most adopted Agile Process

Characteristics:
1. Lightweight
2. Focus on managing people rather than technical complexity or final product (XP)
3. Generate value through adaptive solutions
4. Iterative and incremental approach
5. Optimize predictability and control risk

Pillars:
- Transparency: i.e. if you can't make it in time, get the customer know
- Adaptation: Respond to change
- Inspection: Every step of iteration there is inspection
	- Inspection with the customer (sprint review)
	- Inspection with the team (retrospection)

Values:
- Commitment: deliver in time, even it is not perfect
- Focus: one project at a time
- Openness
- Respect
- Courage: able to say no and able to say yes to customer

## Scrum Team
No specialization in Scrum, only three roles. Customer is excluded from the team.

Product owner:
- Expert with the logic and customer request
- Do meeting with the customer
- Define user story
- Define vision
- Manage development team
- Focus on optimization of product backlog, so it meets the requirement
- Quality assurance before the release being delivered to the customer

Development team:
- Converting program backlog into software
- The developer
- Analysis, design code, test, documentation, and QA.

Scrum master:
- Make sure the scrum is working
- Controls the run of project in term of scrum discipline
- Manages relationship between product owner and the scrum team
- Focuses on team improvement

Scrum master can be the product owner, even can be the developer if the team is limited.

Ideally scrum is 5-9 people

## Scrum Support
Stakeholders:
- The most important role involved in scrum
- Investing to the team
- The sponsors

Business owner:
- Control budget for the team
- Communicate with the stakeholder

## Scrum Events
**Sprint Planning**: planning session together. (Development team, Product owner)
Two types of planning:
- Release plan: when the software is released.
- Sprint length
- Deliverable for each sprint

**Sprint**: time box, expected output. (Development team)

**Sprint Review**: reviewing sprint result with the customer. The feedback can be used to change sprint planning and the sprint itself. (The product owner and the customer)

**Sprint Retrospective**: Review with the team after sprint review is closed, in order to share the changes to the team. (It should be full team).

**Daily Scrum**: Scrum event that happens everyday in a sprint. (Development team, Product owner(recommended))

**Scrum Artifacts**: Artifacts that related to the scrum, except the software itself:
- Product backlog
- Sprint backlog
- Definition on done

## Scrum process
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020211027203907.png)

On customer meeting, PO discuss about:
- Urgency
- Order based on business process, i.e. please display the debit card payment before credit card payment.

On meeting, the team discuss about:
- Complexity
- Order based on technical issue, i.e. we can't create login page without the registration process in the first place.
- Placement in the sprint

Product backlog is based on the customer need (non-technical)

Sprint backlog is based on the development team (technical)

Initial product backlog is 30, as the time go, the product back log will be reduced. If there is a spike it is called anomaly. The scrum team should analyze that anomaly.

Daily scrum (5-15 minutes in small team) discuss about:
- what i i did yesterday
- what i do today
- what challenge i face


## Scrum rules
- No roles in scrum team, i.e. database engineer, backend developer, etc. (not explicitly stated). If the database engineer is not available today, another person should take his/her job to design the database.
- One door service, the customer should only discuss to the product owner to communicate his/her need.

## Difference Scrum and XP
Scrum
- Project management
- People
- Customer is excluded to the team

XP
- Technical complexity
- Product
- Customer is included to the team

## Scrum Workshop in the Recording
**Epic**: we move anything (vision and mission)
**Features**: we deliver food to customer
**Product backlog**: as the customer i want to select and search my favorite food merchants.
**Task backlog**: Based on product backlog, 
- Creating merchant table
- Creating search page
- Creating filter page
- Creating sorting page

One epic has many features, one feature has many product backlogs, one product backlog has many task backlogs.

Whats done mean?
The state of done of product backlog is based on the customer
The state of done of task backlog is based on the development team
