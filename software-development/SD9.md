## What is Scrum
Scrum is implemented not only in software development, but also on project management.

Choose Scrum if the project management is harder than technical difficulty. 
1. Resource
2. Time
3. Multi-years project
4. Multiple stakeholders

Scrum is the most adopted Agile Process

Characteristics:
1. Lightweight
2. Focus on managing people rather than technical complexity or final product (XP)
3. Generate value through adaptive solutions
4. Iterative and incremental approach
5. Optimize predictability and control risk

Pillars:
- Transparency: i.e. if you can't make it in time, get the customer know
- Adaptation: Respond to change
- Inspection: Every step of iteration there is inspection
	- Inspection with the customer (sprint review)
	- Inspection with the team (retrospection)

Values:
- Commitment: deliver in time, even it is not perfect
- Focus: one project at a time
- Openness
- Respect
- Courage: able to say no and able to say yes to customer

## Scrum Team
No specialization in Scrum, only three roles. Customer is excluded from the team.

Product owner:
- Expert with the logic and customer request
- Do meeting with the customer
- Define user story
- Define vision
- Manage development team
- Focus on optimization of product backlog, so it meets the requirement

Development team:
- Converting program backlog into software
- The developer
- Analysis, design code, test, documentation, and QA.

Scrum master:
- Make sure the scrum is working
- Controls the run of project in term of scrum discipline
- Manages relationship between product owner and the scrum team
- Focuses on team improvement

Scrum master can be the product owner, even can be the developer if the team is limited.

Ideally scrum is 5-9 people

## Scrum Support
Stakeholders:
- The most important role involved in scrum
- Investing to the team
- The sponsors

Business owner:
- Control budget for the team
- Communicate with the stakeholder

## Scrum Events
**Sprint Planning**: planning session together.
Two types of planning:
- Release plan: when the software is released.
- Sprint plan: when each sprint is started and ended.
