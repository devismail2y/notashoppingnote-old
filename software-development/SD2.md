# Software Development
Kuliah by Ridi Ferdiana

Output = Software
Coding ~ 70%
Others ~ 30%

Difficulties:
1. Technology = programming language, container & kubernetes, cloud
2. Requirements = technology vendors
3. Team & communication
4. Learning curve

Modern Software Crisis
- Cost too much
- Takes time
- Shorter lifetime
- Does not meet user requirements
- Difficult to maintain

Seven Problems on Modern Software Development
- Big process tyranny: the software is complex enough for today business, a lot of function, big process, solution: agile separates software to small releases.
- Poor codes quality, solution: test
- Poor lifecycle changes management, solution: agile to facilitate changes, requirement management.
- Too much craft, too little engineering, solution: architecture, design pattern
- Development team doesn't want to learn new things, solution: SDLC, agile.
- Learning doing good software from the unicorn, solution: software development process that suitable to your team.

## SDLC
Software process (what)
- Agile, iterative and incremental
- Formal, sequential

Software method (how)
- Waterfall
- XP
- DSDM
- Scrum
- Crystal
- RUP

## Failure Types
Faults in the code: software quality
- Allowing requirements to be changed uncontrolled
- Ignoring the results of testing
- Loss of developers
- Insufficient understanding problems

Faults in the process: software ok, but maybe doesn't meet the customer's requirements.
- Ad hoc and verbal specification (the documentation of customer's specification)
- Customer changes rapidly 
- Unable to say no to customer
- Ignoring Standard Operational Procedure (SOP)
- Too much decoration and artefact (if customer doesn't need 2fa, don't implement 2fa)
- Past technology for future implementation
- Lack of engineering design (read about design pattern and architecture pattern)

## Habits of Manager when Facing Software Development Crisis
- Releasing a product before it is ready (H1).
- Hiring someone in the middle or end of the project (H2).
- Making every decision is development consensus (H3).
- Promoting developer a bonus (H4)
- Delegating absolute control to a project lead/dev lead (H5)
- Negotiate features sets and schedules (H6)
- Ignoring process in order to release quickly (H7)

## Modern Software Challenges
- Creativity: software should uniquely different/valuable
- Estimation: software should be estimated in term ROI/users
- Intangible: software (is not) an asset yet
- Complex: providing a lot of features to provide intention rate.

## Software Crisis Current Solution
- Feedback based software development -> agile
- Evolutionary techniques -> agile
- Core system/framework -> software development framework(laravel, node js, etc) & software engineering framework(scrum, rational unified process, etc)
- Software defect prevention -> software estimation, AI + ML
- Test driven development -> agile

## Software Engineering Framework
- Software tools -> vs code, live code
- Software practices -> pair programming, power programming
- Software method -> Extreme programming
- Software process -> Agile

Software Development Organization Model
- Startup/smaller company
	- Multiple roles on a peoples
	- Sporadic management
	- Development-phase survival model
	- Revenue based software/services

- Enterprise
	- Specific roles
	- Comply with the law or regulation
	- Maintenance-phase survival model
	- Internal use only software

Improving effectiveness on software development
