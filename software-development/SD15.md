# Global Software Development
Multiple geographic locations
- one country different region
- several countries

Reasons
- limited trained workforce in technologies that are required to build complex systems
- to be near with the customer (localization), to be close to a local market
- saving development cost
- shift-based work system -> around the clock follow the sun
- advances in infrastructure (i.e. availability internet bandwidth, software development and integration tools)

Challenge
- ineffective communication, coordination, and monitoring
- visibility and availability i.e. because of different timezone
-  cultural and language differences
-  logistical issues, i.e. different internet connection, resources, or access
-  lack of work pressure

Success factor
- reduce ambiguity through standard and detail
- maximize stability through process or method
- understand dependencies
- facilitate coordination i.e. by pointing regional coordinator
- balance flexibility and rigid (when the software has huge users, the flexibility will be longer -> Microsoft 6 months trial. When the software has smaller users, the flexibility will be shorter -> Visual Studio 3 months trials)

## Planning GSD
Process Framework, every organization has their own version. The generic version is:

Element:
- Business Goal -> Windows 11 improving productivity by upgrading the UI
- Product vision -> seamless upgrading from previous version
- Requirement engineering -> creating detail specification
- Project Planning -> Activity -> a lot of meetings, grouping based on the specific feature and responsibility (i.e. driver group, core system group, etc)
- Architecture design -> creating compatibility between different version
- Product Development -> integration between project plan and product plan, combination between technical team with non-technical team.

Managerial Roles:
Program Manager = responsible for project planning and deliverables such as Microsoft Office in general.
Product Manager = responsible for requirement engineering and activity such as deliver specific product such as Microsoft Word. He/she focus on 1 product.

## Framework
Example:
- Global software development - formal method
- Global eXtreme programming - agile method

## Requirements Engineering
This example framework similar with co-located software development

> co-located software development: there is a functional team working on a project sharing within the same workspace. This is beneficial to organizations which have distributed worker or even outsourcing.

## Architecture Development in GSD

Different with the architecture development in co-located software development. It should have less coupling (dependencies) with one and the others. 

Example: 4 layers of developing C# code in VSCode
- the editor itself
- extension C#
- OmniSharp (compiler)
- .NET SDK (runtime)
Each layer based on microservice (serverless and interaction between each components)

ASR workshop -> Architecture Structure Requirement -> activity to validate the architecture.

GSD focused on architecture design, so they remove
