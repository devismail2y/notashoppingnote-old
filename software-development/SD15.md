# Global Software Development
Multiple geographic locations
- one country different region
- several countries

Reasons
- limited trained workforce in technologies that are required to build complex systems
- to be near with the customer (localization), to be close to a local market
- saving development cost
- shift-based work system -> around the clock follow the sun
- advances in infrastructure (i.e. availability internet bandwidth, software development and integration tools)

Challenge
- ineffective communication, coordination, and monitoring
- Visibilit
