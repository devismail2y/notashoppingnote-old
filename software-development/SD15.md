# Global Software Development
Multiple geographic locations
- one country different region
- several countries

Reasons
- limited trained workforce in technologies that are required to build complex systems
- to be near with the customer (localization), to be close to a local market
- saving development cost
- shift-based work system -> around the clock follow the sun
- advances in infrastructure (i.e. availability internet bandwidth, software development and integration tools)

Challenge
- ineffective communication, coordination, and monitoring
- visibility and availability i.e. because of different timezone
-  cultural and language differences
-  logistical issues, i.e. different internet connection, resources, or access
-  lack of work pressure

Success factor
- reduce ambiguity through standard and detail
- maximize stability through process or method
- understand dependencies
- facilitate coordination i.e. by pointing regional coordinator
- balance flexibility and rigid
