Capability Maturity Model Integration
![](attachments/MicrosoftTeams-image%201.png)

- XP focus on the process.
- Scrum focus on time-boxed delivery, dedicated for small and medium project, today it can be used for more complex things.
- CMMI for inhouse software development in multinational company.

Product oriented, focusing on their resources to comply with organization, government.
For medium to large company

Measures the maturity of the software development process and the software itself on a scale of 1 to 5.

CMMI is developed based on
- Capability Maturity Model for Software (SW-CMM), i.e is the software fulfill the need of the company.
- System Engineering Capability Model (SECM), i.e. if a developer leave his/her job, can you maintain the software?
- Integrated Product Development Capability Maturity Model (IPD-CMM), integration between softwares in the company.

## CMM vs CMMI
- CMMI is natural evolution of CMM.
- More explicit linkage between management and engineering.
- More coverage in life cycle and engineering activities.
- Incorporation of the best practices from additional areas, e.g. management, measurement.
- Additional organizational functions
- More compliance with relevant ISO standaards
- More proven and robust high maturity practices

## Why Choosing CMMI
- To improve software-development processes.
- To evaluate capability of a software company.
- You are multinational company, or huge company and you must fulfill standards.
 
## Body Component for CMMI

## Benefits
- Cost reduction
- Less time needed to complete the task
- Improved quality

## CMMI Features
Specific feature that benefit to specific organization.
- CMMI for Development (CMMI-DEV)
	- Address the development of product and service systems
- CMMI for Acquisition(CMMI-ACQ) 
	- Aid organizations which are acquiring products and services or soutsourcing the development of delivery of product and services
- CMMI for Services (CMMI-SVC)
	- To get the same results and benefits in their service deployment efforts that they currently enjoy in their development effort.
	- I.e. inviting other vendors for your application and maintain the quality of the application.

> Is CMMI can be adopted in government? Yes, because government is dynamic, structural. It is a good case study.

## Models: Staged CMMI

To adapt CMMI in your organization, you should assess what CMMI level on your organization.

What happen if a company have already in level 5?
- Stay in level 5 by keep doing the innovation.
- Expand/split the business. i.e. amazon -> amazon commerce and web services.
- Do continuous improvement and limit the focus to improve efficiently.

## Models: Continuous
If staged is capability in overall area, continuous is in specific area.

Organization may choose the process most important to their business and apply necessary rigor to achieve a "capability" for managing development.
- Designed to focus on specific individual process areas.
- Has 6 capability levels (ranged from 0 to 5)
- Process areas are arranged into functional categories.
- Start with any process area.

Capability level is a well-defined evolutionary plateau describing the organization's capability relative to a process area.

- Performed is simply the feature is working.
- Managed is the level that it has loyal customer.
- Defined is when you have the clear road map when and how the product will be improved.
- Quantitatively managed is control the user about  how they use the service.
- Optimizing is pushing the nice to have features to essential features.

## The difference between staged and continuous model.

## Maturity Level
### Level 1: Initial
- Process are usually ad hoc and chaotic
- Organization usually does not provide a stable environment
- Maturity level 1 organizations often produce products and services that works
- Tendency to over commit
- Abandon processes in the time of the crisis
- Not able to repeat their past success/

### Level 2: 
- Organizations has achieved all the specific and generic goals
- Projects of the organization have ensured that:
	- Requirements are managed
	- Processes are planned
	- Performed, measured, and controlled
- Process areas
	- Requirements management (REQM) to manage the requirements of the project's products and product components and to identify inconsistencies between the requirements and work products.
	- Project planning to establish and maintain plans that define project activities.
	- Project monitoring control to provide an understanding of the projects progress so that appropriate corrective actions can be taken when project's performance deviates significantly from the plan.
	- Supplier agreement management to manage the acquisition of products from suppliers.

### Level 3
- Processes are well characterized, and understood, are described in standards, procedures, tools, and methods.
- The organizations set of standard processes, is established and improved overtime.
- Establishing consistency across the organization
- Process areas
	- Requirements development to produce and analyze customer, product, and product component requirements.
	- Technical solution to design, develop, and implement solutions to requirements. 
	- Product integration to assemble the product form
