# UI and UX

## User Experience
Related to user satisfaction with the product.

Platt's first law about UX:
Know the user, for he is not they (personalization = easy to the customer) 
- makes your user happier or more productive
- solve a specific problem or pleasure
- pleasurable state as quickly as they can and stay there as long as they can

Google:
- Google detects your location by using IP and provide user with the corresponding language.
- You can do calculation on the search bar
- Vanilla design, is not so good on user interface, but it is good on user experience

**Study case**
Giving options, but not really essentials.

### Persona
When we create a product, we should have the definition of the users itself (persona)
- who will be the users
- what degree of knowledge

Understanding user = creating persona (fictious, specific, concrete representations of target users)

Persona is NOT an actor on a use case
- Persona focused on scenario (how I do that)
- Actor focused on responsibility (what can I do)

Persona:
- assumptions of the behaviour of each user(people who love adding item to cart, people who often wishlisting items, people who only look at the product without doing anything).
- allows you to focus and design the specific users, to make better decision.
- your system create empathy to the user

Steps to create persona
- understand the users with research and statistics
- examine themes and patterns when doing something
- create individual character who use the product
- create the character with biographical information

Data source to persona development
- user testing
- analytics
- customer data
- customer surveys
- social media
- feedback

Usage of Persona
- design
- strategy and priority
- content creation
- evaluation

### Information Architecture (IA)
Create useful information that displayed into the app. A good IA will allow people to find what they want with less effort.

Persona tells about the 'user' but what they need about the app?
- Fulfill and understand the scenario and activity of the users
- Solving a problem of the user as quickly as possible supported by the information on the application.
