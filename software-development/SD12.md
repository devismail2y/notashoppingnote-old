# UI and UX

## User Experience
Related to user satisfaction with the product.

Platt's first law about UX:
Know the user, for he is not they (personalization = easy to the customer) 
- makes your user happier or more productive
- solve a specific problem or pleasure
- pleasurable state as quickly as they can and stay there as long as they can

Google:
- Google detects your location by using IP and provide user with the corresponding language.
- You can do calculation on the search bar
- Vanilla design, is not so good on user interface, but it is good on user experience

**Study case**
Giving options, but not really essentials.

When we create a product, we should have the definition of the users itself (persona)
- who will be the users
- what degree of knowledge

Understanding user = creating persona (fictious, specific, concrete representations of target users)

Persona is NOT an actor on a use case
- Persona focused on scenario (how I do that)
- Actor focused on responsibility (what can I do)
