# Software Estimation
Part of purpose in software metrics

Software estimation is part of software metrics
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020211208113853.png)

Estimation is not targets or commitment, it is
- about a range/tentative evaluation/rough calculation
- preliminary calculation of a project's cost
- judgment based upon one's impressions

Example:
- prencentage of confident
- best case and worst case
- range estimation

It doesn't need to be perfectly accurate. 20% gap or less then the target is manageable. Larger gap means you need to reconsidering the project's target.
> A good estimate is an estimate that provides a clear enough view of the project reality to allow project leadership to make good decisions about how to control the project to hit its targets.

To be accurate, estimation needs effective project control

Overestimation and Underestimation

So, it is better not to intentionally underestimate, address concerns of overestimation through planning and control, not through biasing your estimation.

## Project Control
Activities:
- removing non-critical requirements
- redefining requirements
- replacing less-experienced staff with more experienced personal

## Uncertainty
Sources of Uncertainty
- inaccurate information about the project
- innacurate information about organization's capability
- too much chaos in the project (moving target)
- inaccuracies arising from the estimation error itself

Cone of uncertainty

It means if the project has the target of 20 days, it can be delivered in 80 days or it can be delivered in 5 days. But every step you make, the graph becomes leaner and leaner and finally delivered in exact 20 days.

If the project is not well controlled, the cone will be fatter

To narrowing it, you should remove sources of variability -> A/B testing (giving 2 option i.e. classic design or modern design)

Another way to lean it, you should predefined multipliers by know-how-much

Unstable requirements make the cone fat -> track it using project management software or using development techniques, such as SCRUM.

plus
- missing requirements
- missing software development activities
- missing non-software development activities

## Estimation Challenge
Estimate project size, can be measured in
- Line of code (LOC)
- Function points
- Number requirements

By not estimate these:
- You estimate costs, effort, and schedule without not
