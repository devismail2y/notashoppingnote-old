Estimation is not targets or commitment, it is
- about a range/tentative evaluation/rough calculation
- preliminary calculation of a project's cost
- judgment based upon one's impressions

Example:
- prencentage of confident
- best case and worst case
- range estimation

It doesn't need to be perfectly accurate. 20% gap or less then the target is manageable. Larger gap means you need to reconsidering the project's target.
> A good estimate is an estimate that provides a clear enough view of the project reality to allow project leadership to make good decisions about how to control the project to hit its targets.
