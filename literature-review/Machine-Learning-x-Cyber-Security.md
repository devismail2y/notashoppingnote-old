## Machine Learning Based Cyber Attacks Targeting on Controlled Information: A Survey
### Intro
ML-based stealing attack: Attacker utilizes an ML algorithm to build up a computational model to disclose the controlled information, while the raw data set is collected in legitimate ways.

Out of scope: disrupt, disable, destroy, or maliciously control a computing environment, and destroy the integrity of the data. Example DDoS attack leaking customer data [14]

Three common vulnerabilities subject to the controlled information stealing attacks:
1. User activity information [26], extracting user's foreground app Android [97]
2. Exploitation in ML and training data, particularly those host Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) [125] [9,51,81,120]
3. Authentication information

ML applied in :
- Cyber attack prediction [123] 
- Insider threat detection [77]
- Network traffic classification [78, 146-148]
- Spam detection [17]
- Software vulnerability detection [73]
