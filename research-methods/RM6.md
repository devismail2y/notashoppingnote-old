## Literature Review (Tinjauan Pustaka)
- Provide "big picture" of your research field
- Include state-of-the-art work in your field: you may write literature review in historical flow.
- Different from introduction, you may put more papers and not limited to 5 years prior to your thesis proposal.
- Introduce the limitations of these works and why these works don't solve your problems.
- GIve proper credits to prior works, not only mentioning their disadvantages but also their advantages.
- Give hints on what kind of solution is needed to solve this problem.

## Theoretical Background (Landasan Teori)
- Explain what readers need to know in order to appreciate your work. I.e. if you propose a particular of Deep Learning in your Methods section, you have to explain some basic concept of neural networks.
- Justification to support your proposed solution: why you use method A? Why not method B?
- If you use mathematical formula, explain the variables in details.
- State your research question (optional)

## Research Question
Research question is the question around which you center your research. It should be clear, focused, concise, complex, and arguable. TO develop research question.
1. Choose an interesting general topic.
2. Do some preliminary research on your general topic.
3. Consider your audience.
4. Start asking questions.
5. Evaluate your question.
6. Begin your research.

Example.
Unclear: How should social networking sites address the harm they cause?
Clear: What action should social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook take to protect usersâ€™ personal information and privacy?

Unfocused: What is the effect on the environment from global warming?
Focused: What is the most significant effect of glacial melting on the lives of penguins in Antarctica?

Too simple: How are doctors addressing diabetes in the U.S.?
Appropriately Complex:  What main environmental, behavioral, and genetic factors predict whether Americans will develop diabetes, and how can these commonalities be used to aid the medical community in prevention of the disease?

Question to consider
- Is it viable?
- Is it better than current practice?
- Which design alternative is the best?
- What are the performance limits?
- What are the weaknesses?
- Does it work well for novices?
- How much practice is required?

**Internal Validity**
The extent to which the effects observed are due to the test conditions
- Differences due to inherent properties of the test conditions.
- Variances due to participant differences.
- Other potential sources of variance are controlled or exist or equally or randomly across the test conditions.

**External Validity**
The extent to which results are generalizable to other people and other situations.
People: the participants are representative of the broader intended population of users.
Situations: the test environment and experimental procedures are representative of real world situations where the interface or technique will be used.

**Tension between internal and external validity**
The more the test environment and experimental procedures are similar to real-world situation, the more experiment is susceptible to uncontrolled sources of variation (i.e. pondering, distraction, fiddling, or secondary tasks).

**Comparative Evaluations**
Compare and evaluate two or more different conditions.
Factorial experiments require comparison, because there must be at least one independent variable with at least two levels.
Example:
Using new (B) and old (A) text entry for mobile devices while sitting.
compared with
Using new(B) and old (A) text entry for mobile devices while standing.

## Materials and Methods
- Flow of research (alur penelitian)
- Design of proposed approach, system, algorithms, etc.
- What is the data set and how to obtain it (bahan penelitian).
- Configuration of devices (alat penelitian)
- Design of experiment
- How to evaluate your methods.
- How to analyze your experimental results.

Principles:
- Replicability and validity of your proposed method or experiment are the main concerns of the readers.
- Level of details can be observed from published articles in your field.
- Provide sufficient reasoning and justification for configuration in your proposed method, as well as choice of approach that you use in your research.

## Results and Discussion
- Explain your results to provide more understanding to readers.
- If you conduct improvement type research, explain your improvement towards previous work.
- Explanation of pattern from your results.
- Limitations of your work how other researchers can improve your work.
- Implications of your results to answer your research problem and to achieve your goal.

**Statistical Analysis**
- If you do statistical analysis, make sure your readers know whether your results are statistically significant.
- Errors bars are very important, particularly if you want to compare different results.
- Make sure that you put appropriate information on both axes.
- Use different colors or patterns for different data.
